## Vision

PsychUp! is a platform, which aims to promulgate the multivaried ideas and aspects of Psychology, from a scientific point of view. 
Psychology is not just about 'Mental Health', it is far more than that. Bringing these principles to light would substantiate the 
power of mind, and its subsequent effects on our day-to-day lives. Whether it be a social setting such as an office workplace, or 
be the Great Gender Divide, Psychology extends its scientific fundamentals omnipotently. Come join us, as we embark on a journey to 
unravel the deepest and the most interesting issues, which might seem small at first sight, but in reality, serve a bigger societal purpose!

## [The Personality Test](https://www.psychup.org.in/personality)

The website implements an innovative Personality test.
A personality test is a tool used to assess human personality. Personality testing and assessment refer to techniques designed to measure the characteristic 
patterns of traits that people exhibit across various situations. Personality tests can be used to help clarify a clinical diagnosis, guide therapeutic interventions, 
and help predict how people may respond in different situations.

The scientific test assesses the user based on 5 factors, i.e., the **Big5** factors.

- Conscientiousness
