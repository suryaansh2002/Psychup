      '<p><span>Gender is omnipresent—it is one of the first categories children learn, and the categorization of people into men and women</span><a id="ref_acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-note-1" class="type2" href="https://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309#acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-note-1"><span>1</span></a><span> affects almost every aspect of our lives. Gender is a key determinant of our self-concept and our perceptions of others. It shapes our mental health, our career paths, and our most intimate relationships. It is therefore unsurprising that psychologists invest a great deal of time in understanding gender as a concept, with social psychologists being no exception. However, this has not always been the case. </span></p> <img class="details-img" src="https://i.postimg.cc/XJWGdF3B/gdp.png"></img>  <h2 class="divTitle div1Title">A Brief History of Gender in Psychology</h2> <p>During the early years of psychology in general, and social psychology in particular, the topic gender was largely absent from psychology, as indeed were women. Male researchers made claims about human nature based on findings that were restricted to a small portion of the population, namely, white, young, able-bodied, middle-class, heterosexual men [see Etaugh, <a id="ref_acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0017" class="type2" href="https://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309#acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0017">2016</a>; a phenomenon that has been termed androcentrism (Hegarty, & Buechel, <a id="ref_acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0030" class="type2" href="https://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309#acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0030">2006</a>)]. If women and girls were mentioned at all, they were usually seen as inferior to men and boys (e.g., Hall, <a id="ref_acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0029" class="type2" href="https://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309#acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0029">1904</a>).</p> <p>This invisibility of women within psychology changed with a rise of the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Here, more women entered psychology, demanded to be seen, and pushed back against the narrative of women as inferior. They argued that psychology’s androcentrism, and the sexist views of psychologists, had not only biased psychological theory and research, but also contributed to and reinforced gender inequality in society. For example, Weisstein (<a id="ref_acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0057" class="type2" href="https://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309#acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0057">1968</a>) argued that most claims about women made by prominent psychologists, such as Freud and Erikson, lacked an evidential grounding and were instead based on these men’s fantasies of what women were like rather than empirical data. A few years later, Maccoby and Jacklin (<a id="ref_acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0037" class="type2" href="https://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309#acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0037">1974</a>) published their seminal work, <span class="work">The Psychology of Sex Differences</span>, which synthesized the literature on sex differences and concluded that there were few (but some) sex differences. This led to a growth of interest in the social origins of sex differences, with a shift away from a psychology of <em>sex</em> (i.e., biologically determined male vs. female) and toward a psychology of <em>gender</em> (i.e., socially constructed masculine vs. feminine).</p> <p>Since then, the psychology of gender has become a respected and widely represented subdiscipline within psychology. In a fascinating analysis of the history of feminism and psychology, Eagly, Eaton, Rose, Riger, and McHugh (<a id="ref_acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0013" class="type2" href="https://oxfordre.com/psychology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-309#acrefore-9780190236557-e-309-bibItem-0013">2012</a>) examined publications on sex differences, gender, and women from <span class="date">1960 to 2009</span>. In those 50 years, the number of annual publications rose from close to zero to over 6,500. As a proportion of all psychology articles, one can also see a marked rise in popularity in gender articles from <span class="date">1960 to 2009</span>, with peak years of interest in the late 1970s and 1990s. In line with the aforementioned shift from sex differences to gender differences, the largest proportion of these articles fall into the topic of “social processes and social issues,” which includes research on gender roles, masculinity, and femininity.</p> <h2>Why Does Representation Matter in Psychology?</h2> <p>At its core, psychology aims to understand human behavior. Without addressing the impact and importance of race and diversity, it can be argued that psychology is incomplete. Hence it is essential to comprehend the importance of race and diversity. Representation of various races, gender,creed and caste is what really builds up a beautiful and balanced society.<br />Gender and Diversity Psychology aims to analyse and address this issue.</p>',

    '<p><span>Consumer psychology aims to pinpoint exactly why people make the decisions they do. As a field of study, it is driven by the realization that if businesses can understand why people make decisions, they can use this knowledge to hone their products and marketing strategies, in effect increasing their attractiveness.</span></p><img class="details-img" src="https://i.postimg.cc/qM27Xqb8/cmp.jpg"></img> <p><span>Consumer psychology involves finding answers to a wide range of questions, including:</span></p> <p><span>&bull; How do consumers select between competing brands, and what makes them choose a particular option?</span></p> <p><span>&bull; How are consumers influenced by factors in their environment, including media and culture?</span></p> <p><span>&bull; How do consumers behave when shopping on the high street?</span></p> <p><span>&bull; What factors make a consumer switch brands?</span></p> <p><span>The answers to these questions and many more, help businesses make changes to their products and marketing strategies so that they become more attractive to consumers. For example, if a supermarket discovers through research that customers associate &lsquo;freshness&rsquo; with positivity, they may pump the smell of freshly-baked bread through the store in order to entice customers in and encourage them to make purchases.</span></p> <p><span>One of consumer psychology&rsquo;s biggest benefits to companies is the ability to market in innovative and efficient ways. For example, without an insight into what drives consumer behaviour, companies are restricted to selling the benefits of their products directly. So, for example, a company selling kitchen disinfectant may say that the product is cheaper than its competitors.</span></p> <p><span>A study may let them know that, for consumers, the safety of their families is the primary factor when pruchasing a disinfectant. Telling consumers that the product is effective against most pathogens, including salmonella, may therefore be a more effective way to market the product.</span></p> <p><span>If they subsequently discover that consumers are also driven by environmental credentials, they could start using recycled plastic for packaging and advertise this fact widely. In this way they appeal directly to the needs of the consumers, based on research.</span></p> ',

Defining exactly what constitutes a psychological disorder can be tricky and, definitions have changed over time.</span> <span>The first problem is that a mental health professional must first decide exactly how to define "disorder." How do you determine if there is something psychologically wrong or unhealthy about a person? How do you decide what\'s normal and what\'s abnormal?</span></p> <p><span>If you were to define disorder as something that lies outside of the statistical norm, then people who are considered exceptionally talented or gifted in a particular area would be regarded as abnormal. So rather than focus on actions that are considered outside of the normal statistically speaking, psychologists tend to concentrate on the results of those behaviors.</span></p> <p><span>Behaviors that are considered maladaptive and cause significant personal distress and interrupt daily functioning are more likely to be labeled as disorders.</span><span>Today, many mental health professionals agree that psychological disorders are characterized by both personal distress and impairment in multiple areas of life.</span> <span>Learn more about how clinicians define and classify psychological disorders and discover how many people are impacted by such disorders every year.</span></p><img class="details-img" src="https://i.postimg.cc/4NWS0bSZ/pdpd.jpg"></img> <h2><span>What Is a Psychological Disorder?</span></h2> <p><span>A psychological disorder is a designation often used interchangeably with the terms mental disorder, psychiatric disorder, or mental illness. The &ldquo;official&rdquo; term is mental disorder, defined in the latest edition of the </span><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-diagnostic-and-statistical-manual-dsm-2795758"><span>American Psychiatric Association\'s diagnostic manual</span></a><span>, the DSM-5. It defines a mental disorder as:</span><span><span>1</span></span></p> <p><span>"...a syndrome characterized by​ a clinically significant disturbance in an individual\'s cognitive, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental process underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or other important activities."</span></p> <p><span>The DSM-5 also notes that expected responses to a common stressor such as the death of a loved one are not considered mental disorders. The diagnostic manual also suggests that behaviors that are often considered at odds with social norms are not considered disorders unless these actions are the result of some dysfunction.</span></p> <h2><span>How Are Psychological Disorders Diagnosed?</span></h2> <p><span>The classification and diagnosis is an important concern for both mental health providers and mental health clients. While there is no single, definitive definition of mental disorders, some different classification and diagnostic criteria have emerged.</span></p> <p><span>Clinicians utilize the </span><span>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span><span>, published by the American Psychiatric Association, to determine whether a set of symptoms or behaviors meets the criteria for diagnosis as a mental disorder. The International Classification of Diseases, published by the World Health Organization, is also frequently used.</span></p> <h2><span>Purpose of Getting a Diagnosis</span></h2> <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4bf0bee4-7fff-72b5-e1da-ffb1275418bb"><span>While some people may avoid seeking a diagnosis out of fear of </span><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/mental-illness-and-stigma-2337677"><span>social stigma</span></a><span>, getting a diagnosis is an essential part of finding an effective treatment plan.
